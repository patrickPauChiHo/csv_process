This is a Python script processes a CSV file containing information about individuals, sorts the records by division and points, and outputs the top three records in YAML format.

How it works:
1. Reads CSV : The script reads the CSV file with the built-in csv module
2. Sorts data : The data is sorted by division and points
3. Selects Top 3 : The top three records for each individual are selected
4. Formats output : Format the selected records into a YAML structure
5. Prints output : The YAML output is printed to the console

Customization:
1. This script is user-friendly, you can modify the sorting criteria or the number of top records to suit your specific needs
2. You can change to different csv file by just changing the path of the csv file
3. The output format can be customised to generate different data structure or files format
